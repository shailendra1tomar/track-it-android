"TrackIt" is mainly about how people really need to know the location of their bus or vehicle to know if they missed it or not. it was divided into 2 apps .

The bus app:it simply uses the gps hardware on the device to get the current location of the vehicle "coordinates" and send it to the server along with the vehicle ID.

On the Other hand, The user's app: the user is registered to be riding a certain bus ,so when the user's app requests the server for the location of the bus , the server reply with this bus current position ,then the app uses these coordinates to display the position of the bus on the map(Using Google Maps API).
